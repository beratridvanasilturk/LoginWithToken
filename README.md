# Login With Token | Unit Test - MVVM

Using MVVM architecture, the user was forwarded to 2 different screens in the application.
If there is no problem with the token, the user is directed to the application.
If there is a problem with the token, the user is directed to the Login screen. Then the Unit Test created and tested Token situations.
